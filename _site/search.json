    "text": "Overview\nIf you do not have access to a dedicated Git server (usually hosts the GitLab/GitHub platforms), but still want to use Git for version control and collaboration, this page is for you! Most environments utilize a shared network drive, so you can use a folder on the drive as the remote “server”. This allows you to work locally, which is much faster in most cases. This setup is ideal for client environments without access to GitLab or GitHub.\n\n\nDefinitions\n\nRepository (more commonly, “repo”) - a central location for code, configuration files, and minor metadata.\nRemote - main repo, stored in a shared location. Usually a server, but will be a shared network folder for this purpose.\nLocal - copy of repo on user device. Cloned from the Remote repo.\nNetwork Copy - specific to this purpose. A copy of the Remote repo cloned to another shared network location.\n\n\n\nWorkflow Preview\n\nPerform all work on Local machine(s).\nPush/pull to Remote.\nWhen ready, open the Network Copy and pull. This is the “live” version of the projects. No editing is done here.\n\n\n\nRequirements\nWhile you can use the command line for all Git transactions, this page will use the terminal in RStudio. Furthermore, you can take advantage of the Git GUI within RStudio to visualize branches, commits, changes, etc. It’s like having GitLab/GitHub without the platform.\n\nGit Executable, for Windows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou do not need Admin rights to install.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nLeave all options as default when installing.\n\n\n\nR/RStudio\nA shared network folder mapped to a drive letter.\nA basic understanding of Linux command line navigation.\n\nNote: throughout, [some text] means replace with case-specific things. Do not include the brackets.\n\n\nProcedure\n\nSet up.\n\n\nLaunch RStudio.\nEnsure any RStudio projects are closed.\nIf the Git executable was installed correctly, you should have the option to launch new Terminals with Git Bash. Go to Tools > Global Options, Terminal from the sidebar, and make sure “New terminals open with:” Git Bash.\nLaunch two new terminals. It’s nice to have one for the network side and one for the local side.\n\n\nPrepare the local folder.\n\n\nCreate a folder where you want to work locally. I like to put local projects here, for example: C:\\Users\\[your username]\\Software\\GitLocal\\[your project name]. You can do this through the Windows explorer or at the command line.\nOpen the local terminal session.\nNavigate to the empty folder you just created. Initialize a new Git repository.\n\ncd [path to new folder as above]\ngit init\n\nPrepare the remote folder.\n\n\nCreate a folder for the remote repo. Keep in mind this will act as the “server”. You won’t be able to see files there, it will just act as the engine for cloning from, pushing to, and pulling from. I put it here, for example: [network drive letter]:\\[path to your network project folder]\\GitRemote\\[your project name]. Make sure it’s named the same as your local folder. You can do this through the Windows explorer or at the command line.\nOpen the network terminal session.\nNavigate to the empty folder you just created. Initialize a new, bare Git repository. Without a bare repo, you will get errors. I won’t pretend I know why. I learned through troubleshooting.\n\ncd [path to new folder as above]\ngit init --bare\n\nAdd files to local folder.\n\n\nCreate an RStudio project in the new local folder (do this in a different session so you don’t lose your terminals). If you already have an RStudio project, simply copy all of the files into the new local folder. The next time you open the RStudio project, it will automatically recognize the version control because of the .git folder within the local folder. Don’t worry about opening the project just yet.\nOpen the local terminal session. If you do git status, you should see all of the files you just created/copied.\nStage the files, commit them locally, add the remote folder origin, and push to the remote.\n\ngit add --all\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\ngit remote add origin \"[full path to the remote folder]\"\ngit push origin master\n\nClone a copy to the shared network location.\n\n\nOpen remote terminal session. Navigate to a location that will house the production-ready versions of your projects. Clone from the remote “server”. It’s probably a good idea to make those folders read/execute only.\n\ncd [path to network location]\ngit clone \"[full path to the remote folder]\"\n\n\nCreating a New Project\n\nOpen network and local terminal sessions.\nWithin remote folder, create a folder for the new Git project.\nIn remote terminal session, navigate to the new folder; initialize the repo.\n\ncd [path to new folder]\ngit init --bare\n\nWithin Git local folder, create a folder of the same name for the new project.\nIn local terminal session, navigate to the new folder; initialize the repo.\n\ncd [path to new folder]\ngit init\n\nCreate a new RStudio project in a different RStudio session. Save it in the local new folder.\nIn local terminal session (within new folder), stage and commit files, add the remote folder origin, and push to the remote.\n\ngit add --all\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\ngit remote add origin \"[full path to the remote folder]\"\ngit push origin master\n\n\nResources\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/11635493/push-git-changes-to-a-shared-network-drive\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/2199897/how-to-convert-a-normal-git-repository-to-a-bare-one"

Rather than messaging your team directly after changes have been pushed (or, forgetting to), you can configure the GitLab project to send selective notifications to the space of your choosing. For example:\n\n\n\nProcedure\nThe process to integrate is simple, and the documentation is clear. Note: Steps 1 and 2 must be completed by a WebEx administrator .\n\nOpen an incognito window in Chrome. The WebEx site was very unstable for me. It would timeout and not refresh properly. It may be an extension I have enabled or some caching issue. Either way, incognito windows worked best for me.\nGo to the WebEx App Hub. Log in to WebEx with the button in the top right. With the incognito window, you’ll have to do this each time.\nSearch for “Incoming Webhooks”. It should pop up. Click on it. The green button should say “Disconnect”, because the app has already been connected by an administrator.\nScroll down to the bottom of the page. Select the desired space from the dropdown list. For GitLab, I just name them “GitLab” every time.\nClick Add. This is where I was timing out and experiencing weird behavior from the site. If it loads indefinitely, hard reload the page with Ctrl+Shift+R. It always worked eventually for me.\nCopy the webhook URL from the box.\nGo to the GitLab project that you want to receive notifications for. In the left sidebar, go to Settings > Integrations.\nScroll to the bottom of the page to find Webex Teams. Click on the name to go to the integration page.\nSelect the triggers that you wish to have in your WebEx space. I default to all and deselect them later if I want to. However, I do change the “Branches for which notifications are to be sent” option to “All branches”.\nPaste the webhook URL copied from the WebEx app hub. Click Save changes, then Test settings.

However, the colors are difficult to configure, and having a desktop environment set up can be beneficial in a variety of ways. With this set up, you will be able to open the Remote Desktop Connection feature on a Windows machine, and connect to an Ubuntu server, just like you would with a remote Windows machine.\nNote: you will need sudo privileges.\nThere are two main steps:\n\nInstall and configure a remote desktop protocol (RDP)\nInstall and configure a desktop environment (see examples here)\n\n\n\nProcedure\nFollow instructions on this article, under “Using Xrdp - Ubuntu Remote Desktop Server”. I will summarize them below. Note: I also added/edited a few things after the main process did not work. I listed those at the end, under Troubleshooting.\n\nUpdate packages\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nInstall xrdp, an implementation of Microsoft RDP that uses the X Window system.\n\nsudo apt-get install xrdp\n\nInstall xfce4, the desktop environment that works best with xrdp.\n\nsudo apt-get install xfce4\n\nConfigure xrdp server to use xfce as the default graphical environment. The following command writes a string, “xfce4-session” into a new file, “.xsession”, and puts the file into the user’s home directory.\n\necho xfce4-session > ~/.xsession\n\nStart xrdp on session startup, and restart xrdp service to enact changes.\n\nsudo systemctl enable xrdp\nsudo service xrdp restart\n\nCopy default shell script needed to start xrdp and then clear it.\n\nsudo cp /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh1\nsudo sh -c 'cat /dev/null > /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh'\n\nEdit the startup script with sudo nano /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh. Once in the nano editor, it should be exactly as follows, with one empty line at the end of the script.\n\n#!/bin/sh\n\nunset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\nunset XDG_RUNTIME_DIR\n. $HOME/.profile\n\nif [ -r /etc/default/locale ]; then\n  . /etc/default/locale\n  export LANG LANGUAGE\nfi\n\nstartxfce4\nSave the script with C-s and then exit with C-x.\n\nSet the XDG_CONFIG_DIRS environment variable.\n\nexport XDG_CONFIG_DIRS=/etc/xdg\n\nRestart the xrdp service again.\n\nsudo service xrdp restart\n\nCheck the IP address of your Ubuntu server with ifconfig. Write it down somewhere. It will be the “ens” one.\nOpen the Remote Desktop Connection service on your Windows machine. Enter the IP address that you saved in step 10. Select Xorg from the dropdown, and enter your credentials for the Ubuntu server.\n\nYou now have a desktop interface to your Ubuntu server! Open a terminal with the terminal icon, and it is just like being ssh’d in with PuTTY. You can also open as many terminals as you want, which is nice. Another nice feature is copy/paste with right click.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nSetting the XDG_CONFIG_DIRS variable. This was not set by default for me, and I think this is the most important fix.\nUnsetting environment variables in the startup script for xrdp. Not sure if this affected anything, but it works like this.\nInstalling xorgxrdp-hwe-18.04. Pretty sure this was not the error as there were no errors with installation of xrdp, but it worked with this package installed."
