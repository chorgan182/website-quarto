# Overview

# Requirements

While the data may technically be restored to any sufficiently-sized server or database platform, this process utilizes a PostgreSQL server hosted on an on-prem [Ubuntu](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/) 20 ([Focal Fossa](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FocalFossa)) instance. The supplied [restore script](https://files.usaspending.gov/database_download/usaspending-db-setup.pdf) on USA Spending utilized this setup, so I started from there.

| Item                | Requirement                                                                                 | Importance                                                                         |

| Hardware            | Continuously-running server                                                                 | Critical                                                                           |
| Storage             | At least 4-5 TB                                                                             | Critical                                                                           |
| Computing Resources | 32 GB RAM, 8-core processor                                                                 | Low, depends on refresh time preferences/necessity                                 |
| Operating System    | Ubuntu 20 (Focal Fossa)                                                                     | High                                                                               |
| Database Platform   | PostgreSQL 10 (or later)                                                                    | Medium                                                                             |
| Dependencies        | A lightweight assortment of basic packages                                                  | Medium, this process depends on them, but may be done with user-preferred packages |
| Permissions         | Root/sudo user on Ubuntu server                                                             | Critical                                                                           |
| Prior Knowledge     | Some understanding of basic CLI for Linux and PostgreSQL, database principles, and patience | Low, hopefully this guide covers it all!                                           |
